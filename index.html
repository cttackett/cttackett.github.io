        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>My name is Cooper Tackett. I am 21 years old and I am originally from Aliso Viejo, CA. I spent 
            almost 4 years in the US Army as a 35F All-Source Intelligence Analyst. I am currently a student 
            at the University of Wisconsin - Madison studying Computer Science. I love the outdoors and getting 
            out and exploring the backcountry. I hope to visit as many Naitonal Parks in the US as I can but ones 
            I am most excited to see are Glacier Naitonal Park, Grand Teton Naitonal Park, and Yellowstone 
            National Park. I also love taking pcitures of any outdoor location I get to visit and below are 
            some of my favorite photos from my outdoor adventures.
